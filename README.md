# AME-project
In this we are given some tasks and assignments to complete after learning image processing techniques and deep learning models basics.
In this repositary all the soluutions for tasks are there
As part of these tasks I trained railway track fault detection model.

Dataset:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OsSZy0vtTe59rxTGh9EHlPzPFIQUmG2e/view?usp=sharing


In this model I trained a Resnet50 model by applying data augmentation to train data and resizing and normalizing the test data and a part of train data taken as validation data for doing validation and trained the model by using adam optimiser in 5 epochs and cross entropy loss was calculated and also finally calculated accuracy ,f1 score, recall and plotted training and validation losses .
The model achieved a accuracy of 97.3.
